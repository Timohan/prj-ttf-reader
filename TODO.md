# prj-ttf-reader TODO list

This was just an experiment project, so I might not do anything else.

But things that would be nice to improve or do:
* Add parsing GSUB — Glyph Substitution Table
* Add parsing GPOS — Glyph Positioning Table
* Improve the quality of glyph generating to make it more visually pleasing
* Improve the speed of glyph generating
* Improve the quality of kerning between characters, esp in latin fonts
